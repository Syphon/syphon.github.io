# requirements

We are using github pages now, so you need jekyll and bundler. 


# FAQ

* I have a Syphon project that isnt listed, how can I get it listed?

Fork this repo, make the appropriate changes to the markup:
* add a 127x128 transparent / alpha png icon to `app_icons` folder.
* add a markdown file to the `_apps` and add the appropriate front matter yaml markup to let Jekyll see it. Just copy one and make the obvious changes.
* Submit a pull request. 

We ask that you put your project is alphabetical order (will be automatic unless you mess with other shit), and supply icons with matching sizes to other icons. We reserve the right to close PR's that don't meet the above requirements or otherwise dramtically change our mark up, language, removals, etc.
