# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Syphon is an open source Mac OS X plugin technology that allows applications to share frames - full frame rate video or stills - with one another in realtime, instantly. No rendering to a file, no screen capture involved. This means you can leverage the expressive power of a plethora of tools and mix, mash, edit, sample, texture map, synthesize, and present your imagery using the best tool for the job. Syphon gives you flexibility to break out of existing graphics pipelines and mix creative applications to suite your need.

url: "https://syphon.info" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
